This repository was created to host a personal project of mine which aimed to apply time series analysis to Mauritius tourism data.
The goal was to create a tutorial of sorts for basic time series methods and also to apply them to tourism data in the wake of the covid pandemic.
The RMD file contains the codes for the project while the md file is a rendition with plots and results.

Two elements to keep in mind:
1) the analysis was done around the begining of July 2020 so it doesnt take in consideration data from after this date.
2) the analysis is by no means a complete guideline about tourism in mauritius, it should be seen as a tutorial for basic time series first and an analysis of the tourism sector second.
